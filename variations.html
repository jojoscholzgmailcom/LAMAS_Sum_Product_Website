    <h1>Variations</h1>
    We have considered two ways to adapt the original Sum-and-Product puzzle and investigated whether these adaptations affect the solution to the puzzle. In short, the first way is to change the bounds of the puzzle and 
    the second way is by changing the logical statements made in the puzzle. 
    <hr>
    <h2>Bounds</h2>
      <p>
        In the original puzzle two conditions are set for $x$ and $y$:
         $$1 < x < y$$
         $$\text{and}$$
         $$x + y \leq 100$$ 
        These conditions led to the solution of $(x,y) = (4,13)$ in the original puzzle.
        In this section we will look at how changing these conditions will affect the solution to the puzzle.
      </p>
      <h3>Upper sum bound</h3>
      <p>
        First we take a look at the upper sum bound $x + y \leq 100$. The original solution is not unique to a upper sum bound of 100. 
        We assume that Freudenthal chose this bound simply because it is a nice number, however it appears the upper sum bound can actually be lowered all the way to:
        $$x + y \leq 65$$
        This is the minimum value for the upper sum bound to find the original solution of $(x,y) = (4,13)$. As you go below this bound, 
        there will no be solution to the puzzle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lowering the upper sum bound eventually leads to no solution to the puzzle. However, what happens when we increase the upper sum bound?
        Increasing the upper sum bound will still lead to the original solution of $(x,y) = (4,13)$ up until the bound is set to:
        $$x + y \leq 1685$$
        In case the bound is increased any further, there will be another feasible solution: $(x,y) = (4,61)$. The problem with this is, that this solution comes along with
        the original solution of $(x,y) = (4,13)$. This means that the puzzle is no longer solvable, as one will encounter two possible solutions at the end of the puzzle.
        The upper sum bound can be increased further to find even more solutions. By setting the upper sum bound of 200.000, there will be a total of 1869 solutions.<a href="https://btm.qva.mybluehost.me/solving-freudenthals-impossible-problem/">$^{[1]}$</a>
      </p>
      <h3> Minimum value</h3>
      <p>
        In this section we will look at how adjusting the minimum value of $x$ and $y$ will affect the solution of the puzzle. First, we can lower it to:
        $$0 < x < y$$
        This gives the following results:
        $$(x,y) = (1,4) \vee (8,11) \vee (1,3) \vee (1,5) \vee (1,7) \vee (1,9) \vee (4,19) \vee (1,2)$$
        Lowering the minimum value for $x$ and $y$ makes the puzzle unsolvable. Similarly, increasing the upper sum bound gives the same result (unsolvable).
        If we increase the minimum value for $x$ and $y$ to:
        $$2 < x < y$$
        We observe that we do not obtain any solution at all. However, if we also increase the upper sum bound so that the conditions of the puzzle are:
        $$2 < x < y$$
        $$x + y \leq 125$$
        It turns out that there is a singular unique solution of $(x,y) = (13,16)$. This solution remains all the way up to:
        $$x + y \leq 5044$$
        We have also tried to increase the minimum value for $x$ and $y$ further, but we did not have enough computational power to find out whether there is a solution or not with the following conditions:
        $$3 < x < y$$
        $$x + y \leq 5000$$
      </p>
      <h3>Further explanation</h3>  
      Paying close attention to all the solutions that were found by changing either the upper sum bound, minimum value of $x$ and $y$ or both, one might have noticed that a lot of these newly found solutions also fit with the conditions of the original puzzle:
      $$1 < x < y $$
      $$x + y \leq 100$$
      Consequently, why are these solutions not found in the original puzzle? This has a straightforward explanation. When we change the conditions for $x$ and $y$, 
      we also change the possible worlds that are to be considered. It then also has a subsequent effect on the elimination of worlds after each public announcement.
      This can potentially lead to a different solution, even though this solution would fit within the original conditions of the puzzle.

    <hr>
    <h2>Logical statements</h2>
      In this section, the focus is on variations where there is a change in the logical statements. Therefore, the difference is based on the conversation between the agents, which proceeds as follows:
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>
        <ul style="margin-left:30px">
          1.	A asks S: 'What are the two numbers?' -  S replies: 'I don't know.' 
          <br>
          2.	A asks P: 'What are the two numbers?' -  P replies: 'I don't know.'
          <br>
          3.	S says: 'Now I know!'
          <br>
          4.	P says: 'Now I know!'
        </ul>
        <br>
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      As we can observe, in this case, the conversation consists of one more statement than in the riddle we adapted. 
      Although the statement of higher-order logic, i.e., “ I know that P does not know $x$ and $y$.”, is no longer present,
      the two agents use higher-order logic while reasoning to find the two numbers, $x$ and $y$.
    </p>
    <p>
      To solve this riddle variation, we need to transform the natural language statements from above into epistemic logic ones. 
      This transition is similar to what has been shown for the adapted riddle, as we show below:
    </p>
    <br>
    <i>
      <ul style="margin-left:30px">
        1.	$\neg K_S(x, y)$
        <br>
        2.	$\neg K_P(x, y)$
        <br>
        3.	$K_S(x, y)$
        <br>
        4. $K_P(x, y)$ 
      </ul>
      <br>
    </i>
    <p>
      With these, we can now proceed with the program to solve this riddle. Since we are not solving the adapted riddle but a variant of it,
      we need to specify the range of $x$ and $y$ (while the minimum value is 2, the maximum value is 99) and feed the program with the logical statements one by one.
      After this, we reach the solution, $x = 3$ and $y = 4$, different from the adapted riddle ($x = 3$ and $y = 14$). 
      The reasoning behind obtaining this unique solution is similar to what we have described for the adapted riddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In what follows, we will shift our attention to a new variation which is strongly related to the previous one. 
      In this situation, the roles of S and P are reversed, leading to the following conversation and the equivalent epistemic logic statements:
    </p>
    <br>
    <i>
      <ul style="margin-left:30px">
        1.	A asks P: 'What are the two numbers?' -  P replies: 'I don't know.'
        <br>
        2.	A asks S: 'What are the two numbers?' -  S replies: 'I don't know.'
        <br>
        3.	P says: 'Now I know!'
        <br>
        4.	S says: 'Now I know!'
      </ul>
      <br>
      <ul style="margin-left:30px">
        1.	$\neg K_P(x, y)$
        <br>
        2.  $\neg K_S(x, y)$
        <br>
        3.	$K_P(x, y)$
        <br>
        4. $K_S(x, y)$
      </ul>
    </i>
    <p>
      Moreover, the procedure resembles the one described for the previous riddle variation. However, the unique solution is now $x = 2$ and $y = 6$. 
    </p>
    <p>
      After observing these two variations, it is obvious that both the epistemic logic statements and their order significantly influence the solution of the puzzle. 
      This impact results in different solutions for each riddle we considered, ranging from $x = 3$ and $y = 14$ to $x = 3$ and $y = 4$, and finally, $x = 2$ and $y = 6$. 
      This effect is also visible when we extend the upper bound of $x + y$, which was previously set at $100$ ($x + y \leq 100$). For instance, if we set this boundary to $200$, 
      we end up with two more solutions for each variation (we did not consider this particular adapation here), namely $(3, 4), (69, 96), (84, 84)$, and $(2, 6), (72, 92), (72, 98)$. 
      Hence, it is visible that the solutions are different depending on the different aspects.
