    <h1>Variations</h1>
    <p>
      In this part, the focus is on variations where there is a change in the logical statements. Therefore, the difference is based on the conversation between the agents, as follows:
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>
        <ul style="margin-left:30px">
          1.	A asks S “What are the two numbers?" -  S replies “I don't know." 
          <br>
          2.	A asks P “What are the two numbers?" -  P replies “I don't know."
          <br>
          3.	S says “Now I know!”
          <br>
          4.	P says “Now I know!”
        </ul>
        <br>
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      As we can observe, in this case, the conversation consists of one more statement than in the riddle we adapted. 
      Moreover, although the statement of higher-order logic, i.e., “ I know that P does not know x and y.”, is no longer present,
      the two agents use higher-order logic while reasoning to find the two numbers, x and y.
    </p>
    <p>
      To solve this riddle variation, we need to transform the above natural language statements into epistemic logic ones. 
      This transition is similar to what has been shown for the adapted riddle, as seen below:
    </p>
    <br>
    <i>
      <ul style="margin-left:30px">
        1.	$\neg K_S(x, y)$
        <br>
        2.	$\neg K_P(x, y)$
        <br>
        3.	$K_S(x, y)$
        <br>
        4. $K_P(x, y)$ 
      </ul>
      <br>
    </i>
    <p>
      With these, we can now proceed with the program to solve this riddle. Since we are not solving the adapted riddle but a variant of it,
      we need to specify the range of x and y (while the minimum value is 2, the maximum value is 99) and feed the program with the logical statements one by one.
      After this, we reach the solution, $x = 3$ and $y = 4$, different from the adapted riddle ($x = 3$ and $y = 14$). 
      The reasoning behind obtaining this unique solution is similar to what we have described for the adapted riddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this paragraph, we will shift our attention to a new variation that is strongly related to the previous one. 
      In this situation, the roles of S and P are reversed, leading to the following conversation, and the equivalent epistemic logic statements:
    </p>
    <br>
    <i>
      <ul style="margin-left:30px">
        1.	A asks P “What are the two numbers?" -  P replies “I don't know."
        <br>
        2.	A asks S “What are the two numbers?" -  S replies “I don't know."
        <br>
        3.	P says “Now I know!”
      </ul>
      <br>
      <ul style="margin-left:30px">
        1.	$\neg K_P(x, y)$
        <br>
        2.  $\neg K_S(x, y)$
        <br>
        3.	$K_P(x, y)$
        <br>
        4. $K_S(x, y)$
      </ul>
    </i>
    <p>
      Following, the procedure resembles the one described for the previous riddle variation. However, the unique solution is now $x = 2$ and $y = 6$. 
    </p>
    <p>
      After observing these two variations, it is obvious that both the epistemic logic statements and their order influence the solution of the puzzle. 
      This impact results in different solutions for each riddle we considered, ranging from $x = 3$ and $y = 14$ to $x = 3$ and $y = 4$, and finally, $x = 2$ and $y = 6$. 
      This effect is also visible when we extend the upper boundary of $x + y$, previously set at $100$ ($x + y \leq 100$). For instance, if we set this boundary to $200$, 
      we end up with two more solutions for each variation (we did not consider here the adapted riddle), namely $(3, 4), (69, 96), (84, 84)$, and $(2, 6), (72, 92), (72, 98)$. 
      Hence, it is visible that the solutions are different depending on the aspects described beforehand.
