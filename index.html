    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
    This project implements a riddle solver for the Sum and Product Puzzle, a logic puzzle
    introduced by Hans Freudenthal in 1969. This riddle is also known as the Im-
    possible Puzzle, as it seems to require more information to be solvable. Solving
    this riddle is possible, although not easily.
    The formulation of this riddle consists of the following:
    There are two integers, such that 1 ≤ x ≤ y and x + y ≤ 100. We assume
    that S and P are two mathematicians and consequently, perfect logicians. While
    S only knows the sum x + y, P only knows the product x ∗ y. However, each of
    them is aware of the setting described in this paragraph.
    Considering that both S and P always tell the truth, the following conversation happens:
    </p>
    <br>
    1. P says ”I do not know it.” <br>
    2. S says ”I knew you didn’t.” <br>
    3. P says ”I now know it.”  <br>
    4. S says ”I now also know it.” <br>
    <br>
    Determine x and y.
    Our aim is to create a riddle solver which is able to provide a correct solution
    to these kinds of puzzles. For now, we want to mainly focus on the Sum and
    Product Puzzle for different input values. The puzzle involves advanced topics
    of logic, as the (higher-order) knowledge changes after each public announce-
    ment. For instance, the knowledge of S changes after the first statement from
    P. Analyses of this kind must also be made by our solver. Furthermore, if time
    allows, our solver may eventually be expanded with other mathematical riddles
    or variations on the aforementioned puzzle. To be concise, the research question
    is now formulated as follows: ’Can we create a program which solves the Sum
    and Product Puzzle?’
