    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      In this project for the LAMAS-course, we will look at the Sum-and-Product puzzle, a logic puzzle first introduced by Hans Freudenthal (1969). 
      What attracted our great interest to this riddle is that it appears to be impossible at first sight. 
      The puzzle seems to require more information to be solvable. 
      Consequently, we decided to concentrate our project on this particular topic, as it catches depth, higher-order logic and importantly puzzling enjoyment.
      At first glance, it may appear that the statements from the agents in the conversation are not informative. 
      By closer examination and using epistemic logic, it turns out solving this riddle is in fact possible, although not easily.
    </p>
    <br>
    A translated original formulation (Van Ditmarsch, Ruan, & Verbrugge, 2008) of this riddle consists of the following:
    <br>
    <i>
    <p style="margin-left:30px">
      A says to S and P: "I have chosen two integers x, y such that 1 < x < y and x+y ≤ 100. In a moment, I will inform S only of s = x + y, and P only of p = xy. 
      These announcements remain private. However, you are required to determine the pair (x, y)."
      <br>
      <br>
      He (Agent A) acts as said. The following conversation now takes place:
    </p>
    <br>
    <ul style="margin-left:60px">
      1.	P says: 'I do not know it.'
      <br>
      2.	S says: 'I knew you didn’t.' 
      <br>
      3.	P says: 'I now know it.'
      <br>
      4.	S says: 'I now also know it.'
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left:30px"> Determine the pair (x, y). </p>
    </i>
    <p>
      What Freudenthal (1969) did not explicitly mention in his original formulation was the assumption that S and P are two mathematicians and consequently, 
      perfect logicians who always tell the truth. In our project, we will adopt this assumption and include another simplification aimed on avoiding 
      the use of past tense in the conversation. We will elaborate on this in the formalisation section. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, the announcements in the conversation are common knowledge because of the construction in which A, S and P are all present in the conversation. 
      It now turns out that the statements by P and S are very informative. In fact, they are sufficiently informative to solve the puzzle. 
      As a result of announcement 1, it is for instance commonly known that the pair $(x, y) = (3,5)$ is impossible. 
      The values in the pair are prime numbers and if it was the case that $(x, y) = (3,5)$ then P would have said "I do know it". 
      This way, it is possible to eliminate different pairs after each public announcement such that they both know the correct answer. 
      More detailed explanation about solving the puzzle can also be found under the <a href="/LAMAS_Sum_Product_Website/formalisation">formalisation section</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have developed a riddle solver which is able to provide a correct solution to this particular puzzle. 
      In order to not immediately spoil the answer, our solver will have the possibility to provide hints, allowing the user to find the solution themselves. 
      Additionally, we demonstrate different extensions to the solver by involving variations to the original puzzle. 
      This includes the Sum-and-Product puzzle for different values, but also broader generalisations which you will find under the <a href="/LAMAS_Sum_Product_Website/variations">variation section</a>. 
      The puzzle involves advanced topics of epistemic logic, as the (higher-order) knowledge changes after each public announcement. 
      For instance, the knowledge of S changes after the first statement from P. Analyses of this kind can be made by our solver. 
      We will make use of the public announcement logic and semantics as taught in the LAMAS-course.
