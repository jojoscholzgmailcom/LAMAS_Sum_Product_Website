    <h1>Implementation</h1>
    <p>
      In order to create a program that can solve the Sum and Product Puzzle, we first needed to translate English sentences into logic sentences. 
      This was done by hand as creating a program that can translate natural language to logic statements is out of the scope of this project.
      In order to implement this solver, we decided to use Python as it is easily readable and was the best known programming language within the group as a whole.
      For clarification purposes we decided to divide the task into three parts.
    </p>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Translation:</b> Compile logic statements to python functions.</li>
      <li><b>Solving:</b> Model all worlds and apply the generated python functions as public statements.</li>
      <li><b>UI:</b> How to show the user what is happening and what they can do.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h2>Translation</h2>
    <p>
        In order to translate the logic statements to python functions, we created a compiler that compiles from language to the other using a compiler library, namely Python Lex-Yacc (PLY).
        Using this library we created a lexer, which is tokenizing the inpunt into atoms and operators. These tokens are then given to the parser which is creating python code that is equivalent in function to the logic statement.
        This is the grammar the parser is using to parse valid logic statements:
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>function : formula</li>
          <li>formula : formula AND formula</li>
          <li>formula : formula OR formula</li>
          <li>formula : NEG formula</li>
          <li>formula : formula ARROW formula</li>
          <li>formula : formula BIARROW formula</li>
          <li>formula : ATOM</li>
          <li>formula : ( formula ) </li>
          <li>formula : KNOWLEDGE ( GENERAL_ATOM AND GENERAL_ATOM ) </li>
          <li>formula : KNOWLEDGE formula </li>
          <li>formula : KNOWLEDGE GENERAL_ATOM </li>
          <li>formula : KNOWLEDGE_EVERYONE formula </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        In this grammar capatilized words are terminals and can not be expanded further, while non-capitalized words are non-terminals 
        and therefore can be replaced with the right-hand side of one of the rules.
        Using all of these rules, the parser isable to construct recognizable logic statements.
        Atoms in this grammar are one of the variables x or y followed by the number of that variable, 
        which means that this variable should have that number to be true. General atoms can only be used with the knowledge operator and 
        are indication that an agent knows the variable without having to specify the exact value of the variable.
      </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Solving</h2>
    <p>
      To solve the puzzle itself, we created a class that will generate all possible worlds with each world having a different value for x and/or y. 
      Further the relations between the worlds for the two agents s and p are added by checking which worlds have the same sum or product.
      In order to speed up access to the individual worlds are stored in a dictionary with the values of x and y being the key. 
      Then to apply public announcements is trivial, as we have already translated the logic statement into a function that returns a boolean.
      This means that each world is evaluated using the function and only worlds in which the announcement is true are kept.
      To evaluate whether a statement is true or false, we also first translate the logic statement into a function and then we test for the whole model or the specified whether the function returns true and return the result of that.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>UI</h2>
    <p>
      We have decided to use the console as an user interface due to the simplicity and the puzzle not demanding more complex visualization. 
      Though with that choice we have some restriction especially with special symbols. 
      Therefore we have decided to have '-' be negation, '>' the arrow, '=' the bidirectional arrow, '&' is conjunction and '|' is disjunction.
      Furthermore, we have the knowledge operators K and E, with K being either followed by a 'p' or 's' which indicate the agent, 'x' and 'y' followed by a number without a space indicate that this variable having the number is true.
